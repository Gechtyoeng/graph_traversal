# graph_traversal
-DFS (Depth-First Search): DFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

-BFS (Breadth-First Search): BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph) and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
## Task
Write a method for each traversal to perform DFS and BFS on the given graph.
1. create a Adjacency list representing a graph
2. add 6 vertices to the graph
3. perform dfs and bfs

# Example
**Depth-First Search traversal**
input: g.dfs(0)
ouput : DFS Traversal: 0 1 3 5 4 2 

**Breadth-First Search traversal**
input: g.bfs(0);
output : BFS Traversal: 0 1 2 3 4 5
